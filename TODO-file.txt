Fix that the node property is called "radius" when it turns out it's the diameter

clear up 0.33 0.5 modifier in Node and Edge for InfoWidget's position
^ clear up all 0.33 and 0.5 type modifiers? (or just explain them or something in notation)

rename Node and Edge to NodeWidget and EdgeWidget

re-draw updated architecture

fix that some nodes go over the bubbles

rename node_normal.png to name that fits that this is the constant picture???

Somewhat important:

make the bubble scale by the tag size (only has to do so on init)

bubble hides when scale is very small.

make a general function that decides between getEdge or getNode in control depending on if tuple or int,
and replace the paragraph of code I recall from somewhere with that one call.

set a increment variable for the incrementation of basic units (so like, when we
position node at 1,2,3,4 etc.) (like without the scaler) (so atm it's 1)
go correct it to be clearly defined visual item positioning functions and the
zoom function at x_correction and y_correction (that right now look like they incrrement
at just zoom_speed when it should be (increment_val*zoom_speed) where incrment_val
has been == 1 atm so it hasn't shown.

in the default functions, put on for "expand node" or, "show node info"

IMPORTANT:
-1) Add popup to nodes and edges and set it to open on double left-click
0) attach data to node and edge widgets
0.1) use tags from data to write tag on node and edge widgets

1)figure out why node 0 is acting weird and fix it
2)InfoWidget:
	change size hint to fit tag
3)Implement tree functions
4)Implement class in control called "hotkey handler" that can be activated or disactivated
and has on_key_down things for a bunch of key types of has a function that takes in a key
type and compares it to a thingNO make a hash algorithm for the key and turn it into an
int index and get it
example: maps["a","f","d"] do the thing of getting the index of the given key string
and then get from the same index in the functions menu[a function, f function, d function]
index option is cleaner
but hash function is more efficient

STRETCH GOALS:
Change scaling method for old vers where nodes stayed same size no matter what
make bubble show depending on scaling

tag: abreviation algorithm (removes vowels and spaces first) and then only capital letters or first letters after a space and numbers, and then first letter and number

changes:
	control.select(): not takes in an object to directly perform select() and takes its "i" (soon to be renamed "id")
	Edge: edge ids are tuples, control.select() performs by detecting if it is a tuple or an int
	Tag: added tag to nodes and edges

edges:
	change index to head_index-1 and making hash_edge_id() function and
	plug into get_edge()
