in order to get a reliable edge index for the trees, I resorted to using the index
of the child it let to. In retrospect, I might have taken that index -1 and made
a hashing algorithm for the tuple representing the tree which would take the last
index -1.

had to double the initialization of first edge and first node, wish i could have taken
the time to find an elegant solution to the glitch first initialization seemed to have.

had to "nudge" the graph widget after switching the tags because they would other
wise not update to the right location. Also something I'd like to have changed.

I also realize everything I called radius is actually the diameter but I was in too
deep. Ima change that soon.

edge initializes normal and color as same values with different names, preferably
would have found a way around this but oh well

holy crap, I set the visualizer's node and edge widget lists to be 128 by default and forgot
to assign values when initializing my visualiser. It hasn't affected user exprience
only it's kind of ugly to be aware of.
